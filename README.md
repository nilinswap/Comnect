# Comnect
connection behind a Router was attempted here. The server program ( executing at my machine) remains same( because server's only task is to receive connection; doesn't matter where it is from.) 
However the client ( which is at a remote host ) has IP address of the Router with the port being 2020, the one on which port forwarding is done to my machine's port 2020( could be anything ) but client should  know the port on which forwarding is done.
